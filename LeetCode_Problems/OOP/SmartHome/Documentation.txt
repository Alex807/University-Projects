Smart Home Automation System
You are tasked with designing a smart home automation system that allows users to control various devices, create automation rules, and monitor their home environment. The system should be flexible, extensible, and user-friendly.

Requirements
Requirement 1
Design a device management system that can handle different types of smart devices (lights, thermostats, security cameras, door locks, etc.). Each device type has its own specific attributes and behaviors:

Lights have brightness levels, color options, and on/off states
Thermostats have temperature settings, modes (heat, cool, auto), and scheduling capabilities
Security cameras have resolution settings, motion detection, and recording options
Door locks have lock/unlock states, access logs, and temporary access code generation
The system should allow for easy addition of new device types without modifying existing code. Devices should be discoverable on the network and provide a consistent interface for control operations while maintaining their unique capabilities.

Requirement 2
Implement an automation rules engine that allows users to create complex scenarios based on triggers, conditions, and actions:

Triggers can be time-based (specific time, sunrise/sunset), event-based (motion detected, door opened), or state-based (temperature threshold reached)
Conditions can include device states, environmental factors, user presence, or logical combinations of these
Actions can target any device in the system with appropriate commands
The rules engine should support both simple rules (if X then Y) and complex rules with multiple conditions and actions. Rules should be able to be enabled/disabled, scheduled for specific times/days, and prioritized to handle conflicts. The system must prevent infinite loops and detect conflicting rules.

Requirement 3
Create a notification and monitoring subsystem that provides real-time updates on device status, alerts for important events, and historical data analysis:

Support multiple notification channels (mobile push, email, SMS, in-app)
Allow users to configure notification preferences for different event types and priorities
Provide a dashboard for visualizing device status, energy usage, and system health
Implement a logging system that records all device activities and system events
Generate periodic reports on system usage, anomalies, and optimization suggestions
The monitoring system should be scalable to handle hundreds of devices and thousands of events per day while maintaining performance. It should also provide an API for third-party integrations.

Constraints
The solution must be maintainable and extensible to accommodate new device types and features
The system must be reliable and continue functioning even if some components fail
User privacy and security must be prioritized in all aspects of the design
The system should operate with minimal latency for real-time control operations
