			DIRECTORY MONITORING AND CONTENT SECURITY ANALYSIS USING SHELL SCRIPT
This program monitors multiple directories simultaneously, creates snapshots of their contents, and identifies potentially dangerous files based on their permissions and content. It uses parallel processing to handle multiple directories efficiently.

1.  SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
POSIX-compliant operating system
verify_for_malicious.sh script (must be executable)
Minimum 512MB RAM
Available disk space for snapshots

2. COMMAND LINE USAGE
Format:
./program_exe -o output_directory -s isolation_directory [dir1 dir2 ... dir10]

Required arguments:
-o : Output directory path
-s : Isolation directory path
dir1, dir2, etc.: Directories to monitor (max 10)

Example:
./program_exe -o /home/user/output -s /home/user/isolated /home/user/dir1 /home/user/dir2

3. PROGRAM FEATURES
a) Directory Monitoring:

Processes up to 10 directories
Creates snapshots of contents
Tracks file metadata (name, size, timestamps)
b) Security Analysis:

Checks file permissions
Identifies suspicious files
Isolates potentially dangerous files
c) Parallel Processing:

Uses child processes
Reports process completion status
Counts unsafe files per directory

4. KEY FUNCTIONS
- createSnapshot()
Parameters:
	mainDirPath: Directory to monitor
	totalUnsafeFiles: Counter for unsafe files
	entryName: Name of the entry
	snapshotDirPath: Path for snapshot storage
	izolateDirPath: Path for isolation directory
	depth: Recursion depth limit

- moveFileTo_IsolatedDir()
	Moves suspicious files to isolation directory
	Handles duplicate filenames by adding random numbers
	Updates file permissions appropriately

- checkFilePermissions()
	Analyzes file permissions for owner, group, and others
	Returns permissions in rwx format

4. OUTPUT STRUCTURE
/output_directory/
|-- Snapshots_Folder/
|-- dir1_snapshot.txt
|-- dir2_snapshot.txt
|-- ...

/isolation_directory/
|-- suspicious_file1
|-- suspicious_file2
|-- ...

5. SNAPSHOT FILE FORMAT
Snapshot of directory: [directory_path]
Name: [filename]
Last Modified: [date time]
Last Access: [date time]
Size: [size] KB

6. ERROR MESSAGES
"Invalid number of arguments!"
"Output directory path is NOT provided or is NOT valid!"
"Isolated_space directory path is NOT provided or is NOT valid!"
"Directory with path: [path] does NOT exist!"
"Unable to create snapshot file"
"Fork failed for input path: [path]"

7. LIMITATIONS
Maximum 10 input directories
Path length limit: 1024 characters
One level of directory depth
Requires execute permissions for shell script
